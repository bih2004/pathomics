                <h2>Histology Definition and Fundamentals</h2>
                <p>Histology, also known as microscopic anatomy or microanatomy, is the branch of biology that studies the microscopic anatomy of biological tissues. It involves examining tissue samples to analyze their cellular composition, organization, and structure. Medical histology is the microscopic study of tissues and organs through sectioning, staining, and examining those sections under a microscope.</p>
                
                <p>Often called microscopic anatomy and histochemistry, histology allows for the visualization of tissue structure and characteristic changes the tissue may have undergone. Because of this, it is utilized in medical diagnosis, scientific study, autopsy, and forensic investigation. Once the tissue sample has undergone fixation, processing, embedding, sectioning, and staining, it can undergo analysis through microscopy and the findings interpreted by a pathologist. The histological stains chosen for a given specimen depends on the investigational question at hand. Advanced interpretation of the histology slide combined with a patient's medical history can make an invaluable impact on the treatment course and prognosis.</p>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Tissue Processing and Preparation</h2>
                <p>Before specific staining can occur, tissue samples must undergo preparation through several stages: Fixation, processing, embedding, sectioning, and sometimes antigen retrieval. In modern histology laboratories, most of these steps are automated.</p>

                <div class="process-steps">
                    <div class="step">
                        <h3>Fixation</h3>
                        <p>Fixation uses chemicals to preserve the structure of the tissue in its natural form and protects it from degradation by irreversibly cross-linking proteins. Although several specialized fixatives are available, Neutral Buffered Formalin is a common choice for this step. The fixation step is vital to the rest of the histologic staining procedure because by retaining the chemical composition of the tissue, the sample is hardened and makes the sectioning phase easier.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="step">
                        <h3>Dehydration</h3>
                        <p>The addition of ethanol accomplishes the dehydration of a sample. It removes water from the sample and further hardens the tissue for eventual light microscopy. After ethanol is applied, and following the completion of tissue dehydration, xylene is used to remove the ethanol.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="step">
                        <h3>Embedding</h3>
                        <p>Embedding is the process of putting the sample into a paraffin wax or a plastic resin to enhance the process of extracting cellular structures. This step is to be performed with caution if the goal is to perform immunostaining because the paraffin wax will inhibit the penetration of antibodies, and lead to a false result.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="step">
                        <h3>Sectioning</h3>
                        <p>Sectioning involves mounting the specimen on a microtome and cutting it into sections. The preferred thickness is 4-5 micrometers so that it can be stained and put on a microscope slide for examination.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="step">
                        <h3>Antigen Retrieval</h3>
                        <p>This step is to retrieve antigens that could have been covered in the fixation and embedding stages. If the cross-linking of proteins conceals the antigen sites, there may not be as robust of an immunohistochemical response. Antigen retrieval is achieved through heating and proteolytic methods to break down the cross-links and reveal the epitopes and antigens that were previously covered.</p>

                <h2>Common Histology Service Types</h2>
                <p>Histology services typically include a range of specialized procedures designed to prepare, process, and analyze tissue samples for diagnostic, research, or educational purposes. These services include:</p>

                        <h3>Tissue Processing</h3>
                        <p>This involves the preparation of tissue samples through fixation, dehydration, clearing, and infiltration with embedding media. Modern tissue processors automate these steps, ensuring consistent quality and efficiency.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="service-type">
                        <h3>Embedding</h3>
                        <p>After processing, tissues are embedded in a medium (typically paraffin wax) that provides support for sectioning. This creates a solid block containing the tissue sample, oriented in a way that facilitates optimal sectioning.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="service-type">
                        <h3>Sectioning</h3>
                        <p>Using a microtome, the embedded tissue is cut into very thin sections (typically 4-5 micrometers thick) that can be mounted on glass slides for microscopic examination. Skilled technicians ensure sections are of consistent thickness and free from artifacts.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="service-type">
                        <h3>Staining</h3>
                        <h4>Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)</h4>
                        <p>The most common staining method, H&E uses hematoxylin to stain nuclei blue/purple and eosin to stain cytoplasm and extracellular matrix pink/red. This provides excellent visualization of tissue architecture and cellular components.</p>

                        <h4>Special Stains</h4>
                        <p>These include techniques like PAS (Periodic Acid-Schiff) for carbohydrates and glycoproteins, Masson's Trichrome for collagen fibers, Congo Red for amyloid, and many others designed to highlight specific tissue components.</p>

                        <h4>Immunohistochemistry (IHC)</h4>
                        <p>This technique uses antibodies to detect specific proteins in tissues, allowing for precise identification of cell types, disease markers, or therapeutic targets. IHC is crucial for cancer diagnosis and classification.</p>
